# Toy Robot

See [my first solution](https://github.com/developingAlex/tr) to understand the
background on this coding challenge.

I made use of the challenge to practice learning the syntax of Python classes
and testing.

## How to run

Assuming your computer already has python installed.
I ran my file toyrobot.py by executing:

`python3.5 toyrobot.py`

however you won't see much output from that, I checked the code actually works 
and runs by executing it through the unit tests, to run them I've been 
executing:

`python -m unittest test_toyrobot`

## Tips

* The test methods in test_toyrobot.py all start with 'test', that's deliberate
and they will not run if named something else.
* If you place your test files in a test folder, and your other files in their 
own, then [this stackoverflow discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1896918/running-unittest-with-typical-test-directory-structure) will help guide you how to manage that.
